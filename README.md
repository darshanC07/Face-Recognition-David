Heyy Coders!!
This is python github repository for face Recognition.
The stored_faces folder contains all faces known to program. It will compare the detected face(from image or video) 
with faces in stored faces. If it detectes then it will display name of 
the face otherwise it will display "unknown". Also it will draw rectangle around face.
